# Breast-Cancer-Detection-Using-Supervised-Learning-Algorithms

## 📘 Description
This project is my second hands-on Machine Learning mini project where I experimented with different classification algorithms. The goal was to evaluate and compare the accuracy of various popular supervised learning models on a sample dataset.

## 📊 Models Compared
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree

## 🏆 Results
- **Naive Bayes:** 97% accuracy
- **Random Forest:** 96%
- **Logistic Regression & KNN:** 95%
- **SVM:** 94%
- **Decision Tree:** 92%

The results were visualized using a bar chart for easier comparison.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Pandas / NumPy

## ✨ Motivation
This project was created to solidify my understanding of core ML concepts and classifier evaluation, based on what I learned during my initial studies of Machine Learning.

## ✅ Future Improvements
- Use a real-world dataset
- Apply cross-validation
- Introduce confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score
